# ⚔ Python Text Turn-Based RPG System ⚔
Hello there! What lies before your eyes is an attempt of making a functional turn-based RPG completely in Python. Keep in mind that it is more about making a system rather than a whole game.

## Introduction
This project is meant to provide an expandable and functional turn-based RPG system. I tried to recreate a classic RPG/JRPG experience, with custom spells, combos, items, equipment, enemies...

You can freely use this code in whatever project you're working on. As time moves on, I will try to update it, bringing new ideas to the table and improving the existing ones.
